# ISIC 2018: Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection

Submit automated predictions of lesion segmentation boundaries within dermoscopic images.

## Data

![Input Data](./task1.png)

The input data are dermoscopic lesion images in JPEG format.

All lesion images are named using the scheme ISIC_<image_id>.jpg, where <image_id> is a 7-digit unique identifier. EXIF tags in the images have been removed; any remaining EXIF tags should not be relied upon to provide accurate metadata.

The lesion images were acquired with a variety of dermatoscope types, from all anatomic sites (excluding mucosa and nails), from a historical sample of patients presented for skin cancer screening, from several different institutions. Every lesion image contains exactly one primary lesion; other fiducial markers, smaller secondary lesions, or other pigmented regions may be neglected.

The distribution of disease states represent a modified “real world” setting whereby there are more benign lesions than malignant lesions, but an over-representation of malignancies.

## Response Data

The response data are binary mask images in PNG format, indicating the location of the primary skin lesion within each input lesion image.

Mask images are named using the scheme ISIC_<image_id>_segmentation.png, where <image_id> matches the corresponding lesion image for the mask.

Mask images must have the exact same dimensions as their corresponding lesion image. Mask images are encoded as single-channel (grayscale) 8-bit PNGs (to provide lossless compression), where each pixel is either:

- 0: representing the background of the image, or areas outside the primary lesion
- 255: representing the foreground of the image, or areas inside the primary lesion

As the primary skin lesion is a single contiguous region, mask images should also contain only a single contiguous foreground region, without any disconnected components or holes. The foreground region may be of any size (including the entire image) and may abut the borders of the image.

### Ground Truth Provenance

Mask image ground truth (provided for training and used internally for scoring validation and test phases) data were generated using several techniques, but all data were reviewed and curated by practicing dermatologists with expertise in dermoscopy.

Ground truth segmentations were generated by either:

- fully-automated algorithm, reviewed and accepted by a human expert
- a semi-automated flood-fill algorithm, with parameters chosen by a human expert
- manual polygon tracing by a human expert
