# Augmentation notebooks

In this notebooks are ready to try almost all the augmentations available in the imgaug library, each image is timed and can be evaluated for a specific image set. In our case we have prepared this notebooks for testing each augmentation and find the right parameters for each, becoming aware of the computational complexity of each function.
